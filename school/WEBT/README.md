# WEBT Final Project

This is my final Project for the BSc Information & Cyber Security Module "Web Technologies" (WEBT).

I love WebDev and have been doing it for a while, but this final project had a lot of restrictions and criterias, so I had to fiddle around in some areas. This is by no means my best webapp, nor is it my last. But it was a fun project, really liked the module.
